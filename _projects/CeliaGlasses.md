### abstract
What can we say? One of the best applications of 3D is not on our computer screens but something we can carry everywhere we go. So we're going to be breaking into the field by making our first proprietary smart glasses. More to come later.


### project statement
We hope this project introduces a new medium for our company in the 3D space, also marking our first foray into the hardware world. We hope this sets the tone for our company - we want to work towards humanity's future wherever that looks in the 3D space, and we think smartglasses are going to be the new smartphone.
