# 3D Interactive Buddy #

### abstract
The 2000s were the age of browser flash games, which were unceremoniosuly lost by the turn of the 2020s.


> In July 2017, Adobe deprecated Flash, and announced its End-Of-Life (EOL) at the end of 2020, and will cease support, distribution, and security updates for Flash Player.

So many online game portals alike y8.com, miniclip, amazinggames, left without a purpose and forced to pivot. So many great games lost (Age of War, Swords and Sandals, Raft Wars, BTD, and the Impossible Quiz) and without anything to remember them by except late night reminiscences.

We've decided to bring back one of Flash's most iconic games Interactive Buddy written entirely in JS. Let's hope it stays this time.

### project statement
We hope this project brings people to interact with our site and learn about who we are. Additionally serves as an introduction to the 3D space, learning about current browser rendering technologies and 3D scene physics. This will position us to create dynamic environments in the future
