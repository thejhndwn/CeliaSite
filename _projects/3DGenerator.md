### abstract
One of the primary goals of Celia Intelligence Anemone is to create a SOTA AI-powered 3D generator. In the future we aim to release this generator to the public, but not before releasing some long-imagined apps >:) In particular, we are focused in modeling quickly and accurately bounded by cost and application. In the future we hope to model entire environments and their entities, both replicated and unreal. This may require us to breakdown our work, for example separating models by size or application. In any case, this will be the main landing page for the premier work we do in 3D generation and you can find links to offshoot generators below.

### project statement
Creating a powerful 3D generator will empower us to increase the application of 3D. In particular we hope to leverage it in the realms of Extended Reality and three dimensional learning environments. We hope this work will bring our company to the frontier and attention of the 3D research world and when it's done will position us to create our 3D world history map, and our 3D avatar scene studio.
