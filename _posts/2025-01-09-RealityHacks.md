It's the beginning of the new year! Celia Intelligence Anemone is kicking off, and to kickoff the end of the first month of the year, we're going to be volunteering at MIT Reality Hacks!

It will be great meeting the community and learning about all your projects and watching them come to life, feeling the creative energy, and exploring all the new tech and workshops.

My goal is to talk to as many people as possible, to attend as many workshops and talks as possible and to try to make two things work. (1) we hack the Frankenstein AR glasses, or (2) we implement 3D generation and specifically 3D scene generation in AR.

We're excited to see you all there! *I BUILT, I LEARNED, I CONKED OUT!*
